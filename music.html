        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p> I love listening to music, sometimes a bit too much. I mostly listen to Rock, Hip hop Rap, and Electronic
            Music
            and the related subgenres. However, it's not really a hard limit, as long as I like what I'm listening to,
            I'm gonna listen to it. I'm one of those people who listen to the same music over and over again, instead of
            discovering new music.

            Enough about my listening habbits. A few years back I started getting into gamedev, and obviously I was
            watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Brackeys</a> (YAYY
            he's back). There, he introduced
            <a href="https://boscaceoil.net/oldindex.html" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Bosca Ceoil</a> (damn, it
            has <a href="https://yurisizov.itch.io/boscaceoil-blue" target="_blank" class="intext-link">a new open
                source remake</a> now), for
            making music for the games we make. And man, that sent me down quite the rabbit hole. I eventually got bored
            of
            gamedev, but I really
            enjoy Music Production, I've been getting into Sound Synthesis
            recently. I'm no Giovanni Giorgio, but it seems really fun.
            I don't own any hardware Synths (YET), but my software synthesizer of choice is <a
                href="https://vital.audio/" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Vital</a>, an amazing open source synth,
            made by the amazing <a href="https://tytel.org/" target="blank" class="intext-link">Matt
                Tytel</a>. I use <a href="https://ardour.org/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Ardour</a> or <a
                href="https://lmms.io/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">LMMS</a> as my <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" target="_blank"
                class="intext-link">DAW</a>(s) of choice. Haven't made something that I'm brave enough to show here yet,
            maybe
            someday
            I'll add a soundcloud link here.
